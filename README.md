Nexthammer -- a corpus front end
================================


This project was branched from Tampere university corpustools (aka TACT aka
Texthammer) and is an attempt to modernize the look of the project as well 
as to take advantage of AJAX and other more up-to-date ways to build wep applications
(the original texthammer interface can be accessed through [this link](https://puolukka.uta.fi/~texthammer/corpustools))

A more elaborate README is on the way.
